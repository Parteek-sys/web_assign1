        <h2>About Us </h2>

        <p>
            Founded in 2012, Paws & Hearts Shelter is a non-profit organization that rescues abandoned and homeless pets. Our goal is to give every animal the love, safety, and family they deserve.
        </p>

        <p>
            With the help of volunteers and donors, we’ve found homes for over 3,000 animals. Together, we’re changing lives — one paw at a time.
        </p>

        <p>
            Our mission is simple: to create a world where every animal has a home. Through rescue, rehabilitation, and adoption programs, we work tirelessly to match pets with loving families. We also run community awareness programs and vaccination drives to ensure
            the well-being of pets across our city.
